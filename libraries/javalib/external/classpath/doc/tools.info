1.1 The `appletviewer' Tool
===========================

SYNOPSIS
     `appletviewer [OPTION]... URL...'
     `appletviewer [OPTION]... -code CODE'
     `appletviewer [OPTION]... -plugin INPUT,OUTPUT'

DESCRIPTION
     The `appletviewer' tool loads and runs an applet.

     Use the first form to test applets specified by tag.  The URL
     should resolve to an HTML document from which the `appletviewer'
     will extract applet tags.  The APPLET, EMBED and OBJECT tags are
     supported.  If a given document contains multiple applet tags, all
     the applets will be loaded, with each applet appearing in its own
     window.  Likewise, when multiple URLs are specified, each applet
     tag instance is given its own window.  If a given document
     contains no recognized tags the `appletviewer' does nothing.

          `appletviewer http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/'

     Use the second form to test an applet in development.  This form
     allows applet tag attributes to be supplied on the command line.
     Only one applet may be specified using the `-code' option.  The
     `-code' option overrides the URL form - any URLs specified will be
     ignored.

          `appletviewer -code Test.class -param datafile,data.txt'

     `gcjwebplugin' uses the third form to communicate with the
     `appletviewer' through named pipes.

URL OPTIONS

    -debug
          This option is not yet implemented but is provided for
          compatibility.

    -encoding CHARSET
          Use this option to specify an alternate character encoding
          for the specified HTML page.


APPLET TAG OPTIONS

    -code CODE
          Use the `-code' option to specify the value of the applet tag
          CODE attribute.

    -codebase CODEBASE
          Use the `-codebase' option to specify the value of the applet
          tag CODEBASE attribute.

    -archive ARCHIVE
          Use the `-archive' option to specify the value of the applet
          tag ARCHIVE attribute.

    -width WIDTH
          Use the `-width' option to specify the value of the applet tag
          WIDTH attribute.

    -height HEIGHT
          Use the `-height' option to specify the value of the applet
          tag HEIGHT attribute.

    -param NAME,VALUE
          Use the `-param' option to specify values for the NAME and
          VALUE attributes of an applet PARAM tag.


PLUGIN OPTION

    -plugin INPUT,OUTPUT
          `gcjwebplugin' uses the `-plugin' option to specify the named
          pipe the `appletviewer' should use for receiving commands
          (INPUT) and the one it should use for sending commands to
          `gcjwebplugin' (OUTPUT).


DEBUGGING OPTION

    -verbose
          Use the `-verbose' option to have the `appletviewer' print
          debugging messages.


STANDARD OPTIONS

    -help
          Use the `-help' option to have the `appletviewer' print a
          usage message, then exit.

    -version
          Use the `-version' option to have the `appletviewer' print
          its version, then exit.

    -JOPTION
          Use the `-J' option to pass OPTION to the virtual machine that
          will run the `appletviewer'.  Unlike other options, there must
          not be a space between the -J and OPTION.

1.2 The `gcjwebplugin' Tool
===========================

`gcjwebplugin' is a plugin that adds applet support to web browsers.
Currently `gcjwebplugin' only supports Mozilla-based browsers (e.g.,
Firefox, Galeon, Mozilla).

2 Security Tools
****************

Two Security Tools are available with GNU Classpath: jarsigner and
keytool.

   To avoid conflicts with other implementations, the jarsigner
executable is called "gjarsigner" and the keytool executable is called
"gkeytool".

* Menu:

* jarsigner Tool::             Sign and verify .JAR files
* keytool Tool::               Manage private keys and public certificates

   If while using these tools you think you found a bug, then please
report it at classpath-bugs
(http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/bugs.html).


File: tools.info,  Node: jarsigner Tool,  Next: keytool Tool,  Prev: Security Tools,  Up: Security Tools

2.1 The `jarsigner' Tool
========================

The jarsigner tool is invoked from the command line, in one of two
forms, as follows:

     `jarsigner [OPTION]... FILE ALIAS'
     `jarsigner -verify [OPTION]... FILE'

   When the first form is used, the tool signs the designated JAR file.
The second form, on the other hand, is used to verify a previously
signed JAR file.

   `FILE' is the .JAR file to process; i.e. to sign if the first syntax
form is used, or to verify if the second syntax form is used instead.

   `ALIAS' must be a known Alias of a Key Entry in the designated Key
Store. The private key material associated with this Alias is then used
for signing the designated .JAR file.

* Menu:

* Common jarsigner Options::   Options used when signing or verifying a file
* Signing Options::            Options only used when signing a .JAR file
* Verification Options::       Options only used when verifying a .JAR file


File: tools.info,  Node: Common jarsigner Options,  Next: Signing Options,  Prev: jarsigner Tool,  Up: jarsigner Tool

2.1.1 Common options
--------------------

The following options may be used when the tool is used for either
signing, or verifying, a .JAR file.

-verbose
     Use this option to force the tool to generate more verbose
     messages, during its processing.

-internalsf
     When present, the tool will include -which otherwise it does not-
     the `.SF' file in the `.DSA' generated file.

-sectionsonly
     When present, the tool will include in the `.SF' generated file
     -which otherwise it does not- a header containing a hash of the
     whole manifest file.  When that header is included, the tool can
     quickly check, during verification, if the hash (in the header)
     matches or not the manifest file.

-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME
     A fully qualified class name of a Security Provider to add to the
     current list of Security Providers already installed in the JVM
     in-use. If a provider class is specified with this option, and was
     successfully added to the runtime -i.e. it was not already
     installed- then the tool will attempt to remove this Security
     Provider before exiting.

-help
     Prints a help text similar to this one.



File: tools.info,  Node: Signing Options,  Next: Verification Options,  Prev: Common jarsigner Options,  Up: jarsigner Tool

2.1.2 Signing options
---------------------

The following options may be specified when using the tool for signing
purposes.

-keystore URL
     Use this option to specify the location of the key store to use.
     The default value is a file URL referencing the file named
     `.keystore' located in the path returned by the call to
     `java.lang.System#getProperty(String)' using `user.home' as
     argument.

     If a URL was specified, but was found to be malformed -e.g.
     missing protocol element- the tool will attempt to use the URL
     value as a file-name (with absolute or relative path-name) of a
     key store -as if the protocol was `file:'.

-storetype STORE_TYPE
     Use this option to specify the type of the key store to use. The
     default value, if this option is omitted, is that of the property
     `keystore.type' in the security properties file, which is obtained
     by invoking the static method call `getDefaultType()' in
     `java.security.KeyStore'.

-storepass PASSWORD
     Use this option to specify the password which will be used to
     unlock the key store. If this option is missing, the User will be
     prompted to provide a password.

-keypass PASSWORD
     Use this option to specify the password which the tool will use to
     unlock the Key Entry associated with the designated Alias.

     If this option is omitted, the tool will first attempt to unlock
     the Key Entry using the same password protecting the key store. If
     this fails, you will then be prompted to provide a password.

-sigfile NAME
     Use this option to designate a literal that will be used to
     construct file names for both the `.SF' and `.DSA' signature
     files. These files  will be generated, by the tool, and placed in
     the `META-INF' directory of the signed JAR.  Permissible
     characters for `NAME' must be in the range "a-zA-Z0-9_-".  All
     characters will be converted to upper-case ones.

     If this option is missing, the first eight characters of the
     `ALIAS' argument will be used. When this is the case, any
     character in `ALIAS' that is outside the permissible range of
     characters will be replaced by an underscore.

-signedjar FILE
     Use this option to specify the file name of the signed JAR. If
     this option is omitted, then the signed JAR will be named the same
     as `FILE'; i.e. the input JAR file will be replaced with the
     signed copy.

2.1.3 Verification options
--------------------------

The following options may be specified when using the tool for
verification purposes.

-verify
     Use this option to indicate that the tool is to be used for
     verification purposes.

-certs
     This option is used in conjunction with the `-verbose' option.
     When present, along with the `-verbose' option, the tool will
     print more detailed information about the certificates of the
     signer(s) being processed.



File: tools.info,  Node: keytool Tool,  Prev: jarsigner Tool,  Up: Security Tools

2.2 The `keytool' Tool
======================

Cryptographic credentials, in a Java environment, are usually stored in
a Key Store. The Java SDK specifies a Key Store as a persistent
container of two types of objects: Key Entries and Trusted
Certificates. The security tool keytool is a Java-based application for
managing those types of objects.

   A Key Entry represents the private key part of a key-pair used in
Public-Key Cryptography, and a signed X.509 certificate which
authenticates the public key part for a known entity; i.e. the owner of
the key-pair. The X.509 certificate itself contains the public key part
of the key-pair.

   A Trusted Certificate is a signed X.509 certificate issued by a
trusted entity. The Trust in this context is relative to the User of
the keytool. In other words, the existence of a Trusted Certificate in
the Key Store processed by a keytool command implies that the User
trusts the Issuer of that Trusted Certificate to also sign, and hence
authenticates, other Subjects the tool may process.

   Trusted Certificates are important because they allow the tool to
mechanically construct Chains of Trust starting from one of the Trusted
Certificates in a Key Store and ending with a certificate whose Issuer
is potentially unknown. A valid chain is an ordered list, starting with
a Trusted Certificate (also called the anchor), ending with the target
certificate, and satisfying the condition that the Subject of
certificate `#i' is the Issuer of certificate `#i + 1'.

   The keytool is invoked from the command line as follows:

     `keytool [COMMAND]...'

   Multiple `COMMAND's may be specified at once, each complete with its
own options. keytool will parse all the arguments, before processing,
and executing, each `COMMAND'. If an exception occurs while executing
one `COMMAND' keytool will abort. Note however that because the
implementation of the tool uses code to parse command line options that
also supports GNU-style options, you have to separate each command
group with a double-hyphen; e.g

     `keytool -list -- -printcert -alias mykey'

   Here is a summary of the commands supported by the tool:

  1. Add/Update commands
        * -genkey [OPTION]...  Generate a new Key Entry, eventually
          creating a new key store.

        * -import [OPTION]...  Add, to a key store, Key Entries
          (private keys and certificate chains authenticating the
          public keys) and Trusted Certificates (3rd party certificates
          which can be used as Trust Anchors when building
          chains-of-trust).

        * -selfcert [OPTION]...  Generate a new self-signed Trusted
          Certificate.

        * -cacert [OPTION]...  Import a CA Trusted Certificate.

        * -identitydb [OPTION]...  NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
          Import a JDK 1.1 style Identity Database.

  2. Export commands
        * -certreq [OPTION]...  Issue a Certificate Signing Request
          (CSR) which can be then sent to a Certification Authority
          (CA) to issue a certificate signed (by the CA) and
          authenticating the Subject of the request.

        * -export [OPTION]...  Export a certificate from a key store.

  3. Display commands
        * -list [OPTION]...  Print one or all certificates in a key
          store to `STDOUT'.

2.2.1 Getting help
------------------

To get a general help text about the tool, use the `-help' option; e.g.

     `keytool -help'

   To get more specific help text about one of the tool's command use
the `-help' option for that command; e.g.

     `keytool -genkey -help'

   In both instances, the tool will print a help text and then will
exit the running JVM.

   It is worth noting here that the help messages printed by the tool
are I18N-ready. This means that if/when the contents of the tool's
Message Bundle properties file are available in languages other than
English, you may see those messages in that language.


File: tools.info,  Node: Common keytool Options,  Next: Distinguished Names,  Prev: Getting Help,  Up: keytool Tool

2.2.2 Common options
--------------------

The following `OPTION's are used in more than one `COMMAND'. They are
described here to reduce redundancy.

-alias ALIAS
     Every entry, be it a Key Entry or a Trusted Certificate, in a key
     store is uniquely identified by a user-defined Alias string. Use
     this option to specify the Alias to use when referring to an entry
     in the key store. Unless specified otherwise, a default value of
     `mykey' shall be used when this option is omitted from the command
     line.

-keyalg ALGORITHM
     Use this option to specify the canonical name of the key-pair
     generation algorithm. The default value for this option is `DSS'
     (a synonym for the Digital Signature Algorithm also known as DSA).

-keysize SIZE
     Use this option to specify the number of bits of the shared
     modulus (for both the public and private keys) to use when
     generating new keys. A default value of `1024' will be used if
     this option is omitted from the command line.

-validity DAY_COUNT
     Use this option to specify the number of days a newly generated
     certificate will be valid for. The default value is `90' (days) if
     this option is omitted from the command line.

-storetype STORE_TYPE
     Use this option to specify the type of the key store to use. The
     default value, if this option is omitted, is that of the property
     `keystore.type' in the security properties file, which is obtained
     by invoking the static method call `getDefaultType()' in
     `java.security.KeyStore'.

-storepass PASSWORD
     Use this option to specify the password protecting the key store.
     If this option is omitted from the command line, you will be
     prompted to provide a password.

-keystore URL
     Use this option to specify the location of the key store to use.
     The default value is a file URL referencing the file named
     `.keystore' located in the path returned by the call to
     `java.lang.System#getProperty(String)' using `user.home' as
     argument.

     If a URL was specified, but was found to be malformed -e.g.
     missing protocol element- the tool will attempt to use the URL
     value as a file-name (with absolute or relative path-name) of a
     key store -as if the protocol was `file:'.

-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME
     A fully qualified class name of a Security Provider to add to the
     current list of Security Providers already installed in the JVM
     in-use. If a provider class is specified with this option, and was
     successfully added to the runtime -i.e. it was not already
     installed- then the tool will attempt to removed this Security
     Provider before exiting.

-file FILE
     Use this option to designate a file to use with a command. When
     specified with this option, the value is expected to be the fully
     qualified path of a file accessible by the File System. Depending
     on the command, the file may be used as input or as output. When
     this option is omitted from the command line, `STDIN' will be used
     instead, as the source of input, and `STDOUT' will be used instead
     as the output destination.

-v
     Unless specified otherwise, use this option to enable more verbose
     output.



File: tools.info,  Node: Distinguished Names,  Next: Add/Update Commands,  Prev: Common keytool Options,  Up: keytool Tool

2.2.3 X.500 Distinguished Names
-------------------------------

A Distinguished Name (or DN) MUST be supplied with some of the
`COMMAND's using a `-dname' option. The syntax of a valid value for
this option MUST follow RFC-2253 specifications. Namely the following
components (with their accepted meaning) will be recognized. Note that
the component name is case-insensitive:

CN
     The Common Name; e.g. `host.domain.com'

OU
     The Organizational Unit; e.g. `IT Department'

O
     The Organization Name; e.g. `The Sample Company'

L
     The Locality Name; e.g. `Sydney'

ST
     The State Name; e.g. `New South Wales'

C
     The 2-letter Country identifier; e.g. `AU'

   When specified with a `-dname' option, each pair of component/value
will be separated from the other with a comma. Each component and value
pair MUST be separated by an equal sign. For example, the following is
a valid DN value:
CN=host.domain.com, O=The Sample Company, L=Sydney, ST=NSW, C=AU

If the Distinguished Name is required, and no valid default value can
be used, the tool will prompt you to enter the information through the
console.

2.2.4.1 `-genkey' command
.........................

Use this command to generate a new key-pair (both private and public
keys), and save these credentials in the key store as a Key Entry,
associated with the designated (if was specified with the `-alias'
option) or default (if the `-alias' option is omitted) Alias.

   The private key material will be protected with a user-defined
password (see `-keypass' option). The public key on the other hand will
be part of a self-signed X.509 certificate, which will form a 1-element
chain and will be saved in the key store.

-alias ALIAS
     For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

-keyalg ALGORITHM
     For more details *note ALGORITHM: keyalg.

-keysize KEY_SIZE
     For more details *note KEY_SIZE: keysize.

-sigalg ALGORITHM
     The canonical name of the digital signature algorithm to use for
     signing certificates. If this option is omitted, a default value
     will be chosen based on the type of the key-pair; i.e. the
     algorithm that ends up being used by the -keyalg option. If the
     key-pair generation algorithm is `DSA', the value for the
     signature algorithm will be `SHA1withDSA'. If on the other hand
     the key-pair generation algorithm is `RSA', then the tool will use
     `MD5withRSA' as the signature algorithm.

-dname NAME
     This a mandatory value for the command. If no value is specified
     -i.e. the `-dname' option is omitted- the tool will prompt you to
     enter a Distinguished Name to use as both the Owner and Issuer of
     the generated self-signed certificate.

     For more details *note X.500 DISTINGUISHED NAME: dn.

2.2.4.2 `-import' command
.........................

Use this command to read an X.509 certificate, or a PKCS#7 Certificate
Reply from a designated input source and incorporate the certificates
into the key store.

   If the Alias does not already exist in the key store, the tool
treats the certificate read from the input source as a new Trusted
Certificate. It then attempts to discover a chain-of-trust, starting
from that certificate and ending at another Trusted Certificate,
already stored in the key store. If the `-trustcacerts' option is
present, an additional key store, of type `JKS' named `cacerts', and
assumed to be present in `${JAVA_HOME}/lib/security' will also be
consulted if found -`${JAVA_HOME}' refers to the location of an
installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If no chain-of-trust can be
established, and unless the `-noprompt' option has been specified, the
certificate is printed to `STDOUT' and the user is prompted for a
confirmation.

   If Alias exists in the key store, the tool will treat the
certificate(s) read from the input source as a Certificate Reply, which
can be a chain of certificates, that eventually would replace the chain
of certificates associated with the Key Entry of that Alias. The
substitution of the certificates only occurs if a chain-of-trust can be
established between the bottom certificate of the chain read from the
input file and the Trusted Certificates already present in the key
store. Again, if the `-trustcacerts' option is specified, additional
Trusted Certificates in the same `cacerts' key store will be
considered. If no chain-of-trust can be established, the operation will
abort.

-alias ALIAS
     For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

-file FILE
     For more details *note FILE: file.

-keypass PASSWORD
     Use this option to specify the password which the tool will use to
     protect the Key Entry associated with the designated Alias, when
     replacing this Alias' chain of certificates with that found in the
     certificate reply.

     If this option is omitted, and the chain-of-trust for the
     certificate reply has been established, the tool will first
     attempt to unlock the Key Entry using the same password protecting
     the key store. If this fails, you will then be prompted to provide
     a password.

-noprompt
     Use this option to prevent the tool from prompting the user.

-trustcacerts
     Use this option to indicate to the tool that a key store, of type
     `JKS', named `cacerts', and usually located in `lib/security' in
     an installed Java Runtime Environment should be considered when
     trying to establish chain-of-trusts.

2.2.4.3 `-selfcert' command
...........................

Use this command to generate a self-signed X.509 version 1 certificate.
The newly generated certificate will form a chain of one element which
will replace the previous chain associated with the designated Alias
(if `-alias' option was specified), or the default Alias (if `-alias'
option was omitted).

-alias ALIAS
     For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

-sigalg ALGORITHM
     The canonical name of the digital signature algorithm to use for
     signing the certificate. If this option is omitted, a default
     value will be chosen based on the type of the private key
     associated with the designated Alias. If the private key is a
     `DSA' one, the value for the signature algorithm will be
     `SHA1withDSA'. If on the other hand the private key is an `RSA'
     one, then the tool will use `MD5withRSA' as the signature
     algorithm.

-dname NAME
     Use this option to specify the Distinguished Name of the newly
     generated self-signed certificate. If this option is omitted, the
     existing Distinguished Name of the base certificate in the chain
     associated with the designated Alias will be used instead.

.........................

Use this command to import, a CA certificate and add it to the key
store as a Trusted Certificate. The Alias for this new entry will be
constructed from the FILE's base-name after replacing hyphens and dots
with underscores.

   This command is useful when used in a script that recursively visits
a directory of CA certificates to populate a `cacerts.gkr' Key Store of
trusted certificates which can then be used commands that specify the
`-trustcacerts' option.

2.2.5.1 `-certreq' command
..........................

Use this command to generate a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request
(CSR) and write it to a designated output destination. The contents of
the destination should look something like the following:

     -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
     MI...QAwXzEUMBIGA1UEAwwLcnNuQGdudS5vcmcxGzAZBgNVBAoMElUg

     -----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

   IMPORTANT: Some documentation (e.g. RSA examples) claims that the
`Attributes' field, in the CSR is `OPTIONAL' while RFC-2986 implies the
opposite. This implementation considers this field, by default, as
`OPTIONAL', unless the option `-attributes' is specified on the command
line.

3 I18N Issues
*************

Some tools -*note Security Tools::- allow using other than the English
language when prompting the User for input, and outputing messages.
This chapter describes the elements used to offer this support and how
they can be adapted for use with specific languages.

* Menu:

* Language Resources::         Where resources are located
* Message Formats::            How messages are internationalized


File: tools.info,  Node: Language Resources,  Next: Message Formats,  Prev: I18N Issues,  Up: I18N Issues

3.1 Language-specific resources
===============================

The Tools use Java `ResourceBundle's to store messages, and message
templates they use at runtime to generate the message text itself,
depending on the locale in use at the time.

   The Resource Bundles these tools use are essentially Java Properties
files consisting of a set of Name/Value pairs. The Name is the Propery
Name and the Value is a substitution string that is used when the code
references the associated Name. For example the following is a line in
a Resource Bundle used by the `keytool' Tool:

     Command.23=A correct key password MUST be provided

   When the tool needs to signal a mandatory but missing key password,
it would reference the property named `Command.23' and the message "`A
correct key password MUST be provided'" will be used instead. This
indirect referencing of "resources" permits replacing, as late as
possible, the English strings with strings in other languages, provided
of course Resource Bundles in those languages are provided.

   For the GNU Classpath Tools described in this Guide, the Resource
Bundles are files named `messages[_ll[_CC[_VV]]].properties' where:

LL
     Is the 2-letter code for the Language,

CC
     Is the 2-letter code for the Region, and

VV
     Is the 2-letter code for the Variant of the language.

   The complete list of language codes can be found at Code for the
representation of names of languages
(http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt). A similar
list for the region codes can be found at ISO 3166 Codes (Countries)
(http://userpage.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_3166.html).

   The location of the Resource Bundles for the GNU Classpath Tools is
specific to each tool. The next table shows where these files are found
in a standard GNU Classpath distribution:

`jarsigner'
     `gnu/classpath/tools/jarsigner'

`keytool'
     `gnu/classpath/tools/keytool'

   The collection of Resource Bundles in a location act as an inverted
tree with a parent-child relationship. For example suppose in the
`gnu/classpath/tools/keytool' there are 3 message bundles named:

  1. `messages.properties'

  2. `messages_fr.properties'

  3. `messages_fr_FR.properties'

   In the above example, bundle #1 will act as the parent of bundle #2,
which in turn will act as the parent for bundle #3. This ordering is
used by the Java runtime to choose which file to load based on the set
Locale. For example if the Locale is `fr_CH', `messages_fr.properties'
will be used because (a) `messages_fr_CH.properties' does not exist,
but (b) `messages_fr.properties' is the parent for the required bundle,
and it exists. As another example, suppose the Locale was set to
`en_AU'; then the tool will end up using `messages.properties' because
(a) `messages_en_AU.properties' does not exist, (b)
`messages_en.properties' which is the parent for the required bundle
does not exist, but (c) `messages.properties' exists and is the root of
the hierarchy.

   You can see from the examples above that `messages.properties' is
the safety net that the Java runtime falls back to when failing to find
a specific bunlde and its parent(s). This file is always provided with
the Tool. In time, more localized versions will be included to cater
for other languages.

   In the meantime, if you are willing to contribute localized versions
of these resources, grab the `messages.properties' for a specific tool;
translate it; save it with the appropriate language and region suffix
and mail it to `classpath@gnu.org'.


File: tools.info,  Node: Message Formats,  Prev: Language Resources,  Up: I18N Issues

3.2 Message formats
===================

If you open any of the `messages.properties' described in the previous
section, you may see properties that look like so:

     Command.67=Issuer: {0}
     Command.68=Serial number: {0,number}
     Command.69=Valid from: {0,date,full} - {0,time,full}
     Command.70=\ \ \ \ \ until: {0,date,full} - {0,time,full}

   These are Message Formats used by the tools to customize a text
string that will then be used either as a prompt for User input or as
output.

   If you are translating a `messages.properties' be careful not to
alter text between curly braces.
