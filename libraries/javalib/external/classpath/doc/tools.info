1.1 The `jarsigner' Tool
========================

SYNOPSIS
     `jarsigner [OPTION]... FILE ALIAS'
     `jarsigner -verify [OPTION]... FILE'

DESCRIPTION
     When the first form is used, the tool signs the designated JAR
     file.

     The second form, on the other hand, is used to verify a previously
     signed JAR file.

     `FILE' is the .JAR file to process; i.e. to sign if the first
     syntax form is used, or to verify if the second syntax form is
     used instead.

     `ALIAS' must be a known Alias of a Key Entry in the designated key
     store. The private key material associated with this Alias is then
     used for signing the designated .JAR file.

SIGNING OPTIONS

    -keystore URL
          Use this option to specify the location of the key store to
          use. The default value is a file URL referencing the file
          named `.keystore' located in the path returned by the call to
          `java.lang.System#getProperty(String)' using `user.home' as
          argument.

          If a URL was specified, but was found to be malformed -e.g.
          missing protocol element- the tool will attempt to use the
          URL value as a file-name (with absolute or relative
          path-name) of a key store -as if the protocol was `file:'.

    -storetype STORE_TYPE
          Use this option to specify the type of the key store to use.
          The default value, if this option is omitted, is that of the
          property `keystore.type' in the security properties file,
          which is obtained by invoking the static method call
          `getDefaultType()' in `java.security.KeyStore'.

    -storepass PASSWORD
          Use this option to specify the password which will be used to
          unlock the key store. If this option is missing, the User
          will be prompted to provide a password.

    -keypass PASSWORD
          Use this option to specify the password which the tool will
          use to unlock the Key Entry associated with the designated
          Alias.

          If this option is omitted, the tool will first attempt to
          unlock the Key Entry using the same password protecting the
          key store. If this fails, you will then be prompted to
          provide a password.

    -sigfile NAME
          Use this option to designate a literal that will be used to
          construct file names for both the `.SF' and `.DSA' signature
          files. These files  will be generated, by the tool, and
          placed in the `META-INF' directory of the signed JAR.
          Permissible characters for `NAME' must be in the range
          "a-zA-Z0-9_-".  All characters will be converted to
          upper-case ones.

          If this option is missing, the first eight characters of the
          `ALIAS' argument will be used. When this is the case, any
          character in `ALIAS' that is outside the permissible range of
          characters will be replaced by an underscore.

    -signedjar FILE_NAME
          Use this option to specify the file name of the signed JAR.
          If this option is omitted, then the signed JAR will be named
          the same as `FILE'; i.e. the input JAR file will be replaced
          with the signed copy.


VERIFICATION OPTIONS

    -verify
          Use this option to indicate that the tool is to be used for
          verification purposes.

    -certs
          This option is used in conjunction with the `-verbose'
          option. When present, along with the `-verbose' option, the
          tool will print more detailed information about the
          certificates of the signer(s) being processed.


COMMON OPTIONS

    -verbose
          Use this option to force the tool to generate more verbose
          messages, during its processing.

    -internalsf
          When present, the tool will include -which otherwise it does
          not- the `.SF' file in the `.DSA' generated file.

    -sectionsonly
          When present, the tool will include in the `.SF' generated
          file -which otherwise it does not- a header containing a hash
          of the whole manifest file.  When that header is included,
          the tool can quickly check, during verification, if the hash
          (in the header) matches or not the manifest file.

    -provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME
          A fully qualified class name of a Security Provider to add to
          the current list of Security Providers already installed in
          the JVM in-use. If a provider class is specified with this
          option, and was successfully added to the runtime -i.e. it
          was not already installed- then the tool will attempt to
          remove this Security Provider before exiting.

    -help
          Prints a help text similar to this one.

1.2 The `keytool' Tool
======================

SYNOPSIS
     `keytool [COMMAND]...'

DESCRIPTION
     A Java-based tool for managing both Key Entries as well as Trusted
     Certificates.

     Multiple `COMMAND's may be specified at once, each complete with
     its own options. keytool will parse all the arguments, before
     processing, and executing, each `COMMAND'. If an exception occurs
     while executing one `COMMAND' keytool will abort.

     A `COMMAND' can be one of the followings:

    -genkey [OPTION]...
          Generate a new Key Entry, eventually creating a new key store.

    -import [OPTION]...
          Add, to a key store, Key Entries (private keys and
          certificate chains authenticating the public keys) and
          Trusted Certificates (3rd party certificates which can be
          used as Trust Anchors when building chains-of-trust).

    -selfcert [OPTION]...
          Generate a new self-signed Trusted Certificate.

    -identitydb [OPTION]...
          NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
          Import a JDK 1.1 style Identity Database.

    -certreq [OPTION]...
          Issue a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) which can be then
          sent to a Certification Authority (CA) to issue a certificate
          signed (by the CA) and authenticating the Subject of the
          request.

    -export [OPTION]...
          Export a certificate from a key store.

    -list [OPTION]...
          Print one or all certificates in a key store to `STDOUT'.

    -printcert [OPTION]...
          Print a human-readable form of a certificate, in a designated
          file, to `STDOUT'.

    -keyclone [OPTION]...
          Clone a Key Entry in a key store.

    -storepasswd [OPTION]...
          Change the password protecting a key store.

    -keypasswd [OPTION]...
          Change the password protecting a Key Entry in a key store.

    -delete [OPTION]...
          Delete a Key Entry or a Trusted Certificate from a key store.

    -help
          Prints a help text similar to this one.


OPTIONS COMMON TO MORE THAN ONE COMMAND
     The following `OPTION's are used in more than one `COMMAND'. They
     are described here to reduce redundancy.

    -alias ALIAS
          Every entry, be it a Key Entry or a Trusted Certificate, in a
          key store is uniquely identified by a user-defined Alias
          string. Use this option to specify the Alias to use when
          referring to an entry in the key store. Unless specified
          otherwise, a default value of `mykey' shall be used when this
          option is omitted from the command line.

    -keyalg ALGORITHM
          Use this option to specify the canonical name of the key-pair
          generation algorithm. The default value for this option is
          `DSS' (a synonym for the Digital Signature Algorithm also
          known as DSA).

    -keysize SIZE
          Use this option to specify the number of bits of the shared
          modulus (for both the public and private keys) to use when
          generating new keys. A default value of `1024' will be used
          if this option is omitted from the command line.

    -validity DAY_COUNT
          Use this option to specify the number of days a newly
          generated certificate will be valid for. The default value is
          `90' (days) if this option is omitted from the command line.

    -storetype STORE_TYPE
          Use this option to specify the type of the key store to use.
          The default value, if this option is omitted, is that of the
          property `keystore.type' in the security properties file,
          which is obtained by invoking the static method call
          `getDefaultType()' in `java.security.KeyStore'.

    -storepass PASSWORD
          Use this option to specify the password protecting the key
          store. If this option is omitted from the command line, you
          will be prompted to provide a password.

    -keystore URL
          Use this option to specify the location of the key store to
          use. The default value is a file URL referencing the file
          named `.keystore' located in the path returned by the call to
          `java.lang.System#getProperty(String)' using `user.home' as
          argument.

          If a URL was specified, but was found to be malformed -e.g.
          missing protocol element- the tool will attempt to use the
          URL value as a file-name (with absolute or relative
          path-name) of a key store -as if the protocol was `file:'.

    -provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME
          A fully qualified class name of a Security Provider to add to
          the current list of Security Providers already installed in
          the JVM in-use. If a provider class is specified with this
          option, and was successfully added to the runtime -i.e. it
          was not already installed- then the tool will attempt to
          removed this Security Provider before exiting.

    -file FILE_NAME
          Use this option to designate a file to use with a command.
          When specified with this option, the value is expected to be
          the fully qualified path of a file accessible by the File
          System. Depending on the command, the file may be used as
          input or as output. When this option is omitted from the
          command line, `STDIN' will be used instead, as the source of
          input, and `STDOUT' will be used instead as the output
          destination.

    -v
          Unless specified otherwise, use this option to enable more
          verbose output.


X.500 DISTINGUISHED NAME
     A Distinguished Name (or DN) MUST be supplied with some of the
     `COMMAND's using a `-dname' option. The syntax of a valid value
     for this option MUST follow RFC-2253 specifications. Namely the
     following components (with their accepted meaning) will be
     recognized. Note that the component name is case-insensitive:

    CN
          The Common Name; e.g. `host.domain.com'

    OU
          The Organizational Unit; e.g. `IT Department'

    O
          The Organization Name; e.g. `The Sample Company'

    L
          The Locality Name; e.g. `Sydney'

    ST
          The State Name; e.g. `New South Wales'

    C
          The 2-letter Country identifier; e.g. `AU'

     When specified with a `-dname' option, each pair of
     component/value will be separated from the other with a comma.
     Each component and value pair MUST be separated by an equal sign.
     For example, the following is a valid DN value:
     CN=host.domain.com, O=The Sample Company, L=Sydney, ST=NSW, C=AU

     If the Distinguished Name is required, and no valid default value
     can be used, the tool will prompt you to enter the information
     through the console.

-genkey COMMAND
     Generate a new key-pair (both private and public keys), and save
     these credentials in the key store as a Key Entry, associated with
     the designated (if was specified in the `-alias' option) or
     default (if the `-alias' option is omitted) Alias.

     The private key material will be protected with a user-defined
     password (see `-keypass' option). The public key on the other hand
     will be part of a self-signed X.509 certificate, which will form a
     1-element chain and will be saved in the key store.

    -alias ALIAS
          For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

    -keyalg ALGORITHM
          For more details *note ALGORITHM: keyalg.

    -keysize KEY_SIZE
          For more details *note KEY_SIZE: keysize.

    -sigalg ALGORITHM
          The canonical name of the digital signature algorithm to use
          for signing certificates. If this option is omitted, a
          default value will be chosen based on the type of the
          key-pair; i.e. the algorithm that ends up being used by the
          -keyalg option. If the key-pair generation algorithm is
          `DSA', the value for the signature algorithm will be
          `SHA1withDSA'. If on the other hand the key-pair generation
          algorithm is `RSA', then the tool will use `MD5withRSA' as
          the signature algorithm.

    -dname NAME
          This a mandatory value for the command. If no value is
          specified -i.e. the `-dname' option is omitted- the tool will
          prompt you to enter a Distinguished Name to use as both the
          Owner and Issuer of the generated self-signed certificate.

          For more details *note X.500 DISTINGUISHED NAME: dn.

    -keypass PASSWORD
          Use this option to specify the password which the tool will
          use to protect the newly created Key Entry.

          If this option is omitted, you will be prompted to provide a
          password.

    -validity DAY_COUNT
          For more details *note DAY_COUNT: validity.

    -storetype STORE_TYPE
          For more details *note STORE_TYPE: storetype.

    -keystore URL
          For more details *note URL: keystore.

    -storepass PASSWORD
          For more details *note PASSWORD: storepass.

    -provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME
          For more details *note PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME: provider.

    -v
          For more details *note verbose::.


-import COMMAND
     Read an X.509 certificate, or a PKCS#7 Certificate Reply from a
     designated input source and incorporate the certificates into the
     key store.

     If the Alias does not already exist in the key store, the tool
     treats the certificate read from the input source as a new Trusted
     Certificate. It then attempts to discover a chain-of-trust,
     starting from that certificate and ending at another Trusted
     Certificate, already stored in the key store. If the
     `-trustcacerts' option is present, an additional key store, of
     type `JKS' named `cacerts', and assumed to be present in
     `${JAVA_HOME}/lib/security' will also be consulted if found
     -`${JAVA_HOME}' refers to the location of an installed Java
     Runtime Environment (JRE). If no chain-of-trust can be
     established, and unless the `-noprompt' option has been specified,
     the certificate is printed to `STDOUT' and the user is prompted
     for a confirmation.

     If Alias exists in the key store, the tool will treat the
     certificate(s) read from the input source as a Certificate Reply,
     which can be a chain of certificates, that eventually would
     replace the chain of certificates associated with the Key Entry of
     that Alias. The substitution of the certificates only occurs if a
     chain-of-trust can be established between the bottom certificate
     of the chain read from the input file and the Trusted Certificates
     already present in the key store. Again, if the `-trustcacerts'
     option is specified, additional Trusted Certificates in the same
     `cacerts' key store will be considered. If no chain-of-trust can
     be established, the operation will abort.

    -alias ALIAS
          For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

    -file FILE_NAME
          For more details *note FILE_NAME: file.

    -keypass PASSWORD
          Use this option to specify the password which the tool will
          use to protect the Key Entry associated with the designated
          Alias, when replacing this Alias' chain of certificates with
          that found in the certificate reply.

          If this option is omitted, and the chain-of-trust for the
          certificate reply has been established, the tool will first
          attempt to unlock the Key Entry using the same password
          protecting the key store. If this fails, you will then be
          prompted to provide a password.

    -noprompt
          Use this option to prevent the tool from prompting the user.

    -trustcacerts
          Use this option to indicate to the tool that a key store, of
          type `JKS', named `cacerts', and usually located in
          `lib/security' in an installed Java Runtime Environment
          should be considered when trying to establish chain-of-trusts.

    -storetype STORE_TYPE
          For more details *note STORE_TYPE: storetype.

    -keystore URL
          For more details *note URL: keystore.

    -storepass PASSWORD
          For more details *note PASSWORD: storepass.

    -provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME
          For more details *note PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME: provider.

    -v
          For more details *note verbose::.


-selfcert COMMAND
     Generate a self-signed X.509 version 1 certificate. The newly
     generated certificate will form a chain of one element which will
     replace the previous chain associated with the designated Alias
     (if `-alias' option was specified), or the default Alias (if
     `-alias' option was omitted).

    -alias ALIAS
          For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

    -sigalg ALGORITHM
          The canonical name of the digital signature algorithm to use
          for signing the certificate. If this option is omitted, a
          default value will be chosen based on the type of the private
          key associated with the designated Alias. If the private key
          is a `DSA' one, the value for the signature algorithm will be
          `SHA1withDSA'. If on the other hand the private key is an
          `RSA' one, then the tool will use `MD5withRSA' as the
          signature algorithm.

    -dname NAME
          Use this option to specify the Distinguished Name of the
          newly generated self-signed certificate. If this option is
          omitted, the existing Distinguished Name of the base
          certificate in the chain associated with the designated Alias
          will be used instead.

          For more details *note X.500 DISTINGUISHED NAME: dn.

    -validity DAY_COUNT
          For more details *note DAY_COUNT: validity.

    -keypass PASSWORD
          Use this option to specify the password which the tool will
          use to unlock the Key Entry associated with the designated
          Alias.

          If this option is omitted, the tool will first attempt to
          unlock the Key Entry using the same password protecting the
          key store. If this fails, you will then be prompted to
          provide a password.

    -storetype STORE_TYPE
          For more details *note STORE_TYPE: storetype.

    -v
          For more details *note verbose::.


-certreq COMMAND
     Generate a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and writes it
     to a designated output destination. The contents of the
     destination should look something like the following:

          -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
          MI...QAwXzEUMBIGA1UEAwwLcnNuQGdudS5vcmcxGzAZBgNVBAoMElUg
          Q2...A0GA1UEBwwGU3lkbmV5MQwwCgYDVQQIDANOU1cxCzAJBgNVBACC
          ...
          FC...IVwNVOfQLRX+O5kAhQ/a4RTZme2L8PnpvgRwrf7Eg8D6w==
          -----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

     IMPORTANT: Some documentation (e.g. RSA examples) claims that the
     `Attributes' field, in the CSR is `OPTIONAL' while RFC-2986
     implies the opposite. This implementation considers this field, by
     default, as `OPTIONAL', unless the option `-attributes' is
     specified on the command line.

    -alias ALIAS
          For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

    -sigalg ALGORITHM
          The canonical name of the digital signature algorithm to use
          for signing the certificate. If this option is omitted, a
          default value will be chosen based on the type of the private
          key associated with the designated Alias. If the private key
          is a `DSA' one, the value for the signature algorithm will be
          `SHA1withDSA'. If on the other hand the private key is an
          `RSA' one, then the tool will use `MD5withRSA' as the
          signature algorithm.

    -file FILE_NAME
          For more details *note FILE_NAME: file.

    -keypass PASSWORD
          Use this option to specify the password which the tool will
          use to unlock the Key Entry associated with the designated
          Alias.

          If this option is omitted, the tool will first attempt to
          unlock the Key Entry using the same password protecting the
          key store. If this fails, you will then be prompted to
          provide a password.

    -storetype STORE_TYPE
          For more details *note STORE_TYPE: storetype.

    -keystore URL
          For more details *note URL: keystore.

    -storepass PASSWORD

    -v
          For more details *note verbose::.

    -attributes
          Use this option to force the tool to encode a `NULL' DER
          value in the CSR as the value of the `Attributes' field.


-export COMMAND
     Export a certificate stored in the key store to a designated
     output destination, either in binary format (if the `-v' option is
     specified), or in RFC-1421 compliant encoding (if the `-rfc'
     option is specified instead).

    -rfc
          Use RFC-1421 specifications when encoding the output.

    -v
          Output the certificate in binary DER encoding. This is the
          default output format of the command if neither `-rfc' nor
          `-v' options were detected on the command line. If both this
          option and the `-rfc' option are detected on the command
          line, the tool will opt for the RFC-1421 style encoding.


-list COMMAND
     Print one or all of the key store entries to `STDOUT'. Usually
     this command will only print a fingerprint of the certificate,
     unless either the `-rfc' or the `-v' option is specified.

    -alias ALIAS
          If this option is omitted, the tool will print ALL the
          entries found in the key store.

          For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

    -storetype STORE_TYPE

          Output the certificate in human-readable format. If both this
          option and the `-rfc' option are detected on the command
          line, the tool will opt for the human-readable form and will
          not abort the command.


-printcert COMMAND
     Read a certificate from a designated input source and print it to
     `STDOUT' in a human-readable form.

    -file FILE_NAME
          For more details *note FILE_NAME: file.

     Clone an existing Key Entry and store it under a new (different)
     Alias protecting, its private key material with possibly a new
     password.

    -alias ALIAS
          For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

    -dest ALIAS
          Use this option to specify the new Alias which will be used
          to identify the cloned copy of the Key Entry.

    -keypass PASSWORD
          Use this option to specify the password which the tool will
          use to unlock the Key Entry associated with the designated
          Alias.

2 I18N Issues
*************

Some tools -*note Security Tools::- allow using other than the English
language when prompting the User for input, and outputing messages.
This chapter describes the elements used to offer this support and how
they can be adapted for use with specific languages.

* Menu:

* Language Resources::         Where resources are located
* Message Formats::            How messages are internationalized


File: tools.info,  Node: Language Resources,  Next: Message Formats,  Prev: I18N Issues,  Up: I18N Issues

2.1 Language-Specific Resources
===============================

The Tools use Java `ResourceBundle's to store messages, and message
templates they use at runtime to generate the message text itself,
depending on the locale in use at the time.

   The Resource Bundles these tools use are essentially Java Properties
files consisting of a set of Name/Value pairs. The Name is the Propery
Name and the Value is a substitution string that is used when the code
references the associated Name. For example the following is a line in
a Resource Bundle used by the `keytool' Tool:

     Command.23=A correct key password MUST be provided

   When the tool needs to signal a mandatory but missing key password,
it would reference the property named `Command.23' and the message "`A
correct key password MUST be provided'" will be used instead. This
indirect referencing of "resources" permits replacing, as late as
possible, the English strings with strings in other languages, provided
of course Resource Bundles in those languages are provided.

   For the GNU Classpath Tools described in this Guide, the Resource
Bundles are files named `messages[_ll[_CC[_VV]]].properties' where:

LL
     Is the 2-letter code for the Language,

CC
     Is the 2-letter code for the Region, and

VV
     Is the 2-letter code for the Variant of the language.

   The complete list of language codes can be found at Code for the
representation of names of languages
(http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt). A similar
list for the region codes can be found at ISO 3166 Codes (Countries)
(http://userpage.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_3166.html).

   The location of the Resource Bundles for the GNU Classpath Tools is
specific to each tool. The next table shows where these files are found
in a standard GNU Classpath distribution:

`jarsigner'
     `gnu/classpath/tools/jarsigner'

`keytool'
     `gnu/classpath/tools/keytool'

   The collection of Resource Bundles in a location act as an inverted
tree with a parent-child relationship. For example suppose in the
`gnu/classpath/tools/keytool' there are 3 message bundles named:

  1. `messages.properties'

  2. `messages_fr.properties'

  3. `messages_fr_FR.properties'

   In the above example, bundle #1 will act as the parent of bundle #2,
which in turn will act as the parent for bundle #3. This ordering is
used by the Java runtime to choose which file to load based on the set
Locale. For example if the Locale is `fr_CH', `messages_fr.properties'
will be used because (a) `messages_fr_CH.properties' does not exist,
but (b) `messages_fr.properties' is the parent for the required bundle,
and it exists. As another example, suppose the Locale was set to
`en_AU'; then the tool will end up using `messages.properties' because
(a) `messages_en_AU.properties' does not exist, (b)
`messages_en.properties' which is the parent for the required bundle
does not exist, but (c) `messages.properties' exists and is the root of
the hierarchy.

   You can see from the examples above that `messages.properties' is
the safety net that the Java runtime falls back to when failing to find
a specific bunlde and its parent(s). This file is always provided with
the Tool. In time, more localized versions will be included to cater
for other languages.

   In the meantime, if you are willing to contribute localized versions
of these resources, grab the `messages.properties' for a specific tool;
translate it; save it with the appropriate language and region suffix
and mail it to `classpath@gnu.org'.


File: tools.info,  Node: Message Formats,  Prev: Language Resources,  Up: I18N Issues

2.2 Message Formats
===================

If you open any of the `messages.properties' described in the previous
section, you may see properties that look like so:

     Command.67=Issuer: {0}
     Command.68=Serial number: {0,number}
     Command.69=Valid from: {0,date,full} - {0,time,full}
     Command.70=\ \ \ \ \ until: {0,date,full} - {0,time,full}

   These are Message Formats used by the tools to customize a text
string that will then be used either as a prompt for User input or as
output.

   If you are translating a `messages.properties' be careful not to
alter text between curly braces.
