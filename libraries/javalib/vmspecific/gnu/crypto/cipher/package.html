Provides a basic API for using symetric-key block cipher algorithms.


<h2>Package overview</h2>

<p>The following diagram shows the important classes participating in this
package:</p>

<p><img src="{@docRoot}/../diagrams/cipher_class_diag.png"
         width=547 height=318 border=0></p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how to use the AES <i>cipher</i>. It
transforms the plaintext to the ciphertext, and the ciphertext back to the
plaintext, using the AES in electronic codebook mode with no padding.  Note
also the classes for cipher modes and padding schemes for more complex
constructions.</p>

<pre>
IBlockCipher cipher = CipherFactory.getInstance("AES");
Map attributes = new HashMap();
attributes.put(IBlockCipher.CIPHER_BLOCK_SIZE, new Integer(16));
attributes.put(IBlockCipher.KEY_MATERIAL, key_bytes);

cipher.init(attributes);
int bs = cipher.currentBlockSize();
for (int i = 0; i + bs < pt.length; i += bs)
  {
    cipher.encryptBlock(pt, i, ct, i);
  }

for (int i = 0; i + bs < cpt.length; i += bs)
  {
    cipher.decryptBlock(ct, i, cpt, i);
  }
