Provides a basic API for using message digest algorithms.


<h2>Package overview</h2>

<p>Message digests, or one-way hash functions, generate fixed-sized
signatures from variable-sized texts, in such a way that it is
computationally infeasible to determine the source text from the
signature or to find a different text that hashes to the same
signature.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the important classes participating in this
package:</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how to use the SHA-1 <i>hash</i>.</p>

<pre>
IMessageDigest md = HashFactory.getInstance("SHA-1");
md.update(input, 0, input.length);
byte[] digest = md.digest();
</pre>
