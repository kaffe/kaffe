Provides a basic API for algorithms to use Public/Private keypairs in Digital
Signature schemes.


<h2>Package overview</h2>

<p>Three schemes are implemented in this library: the Digital Signature
Scheme (DSS), RSA-PSS, and RSA-PKCS1 version 1.5.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the important classes participating in
this package:</p>

<p>The next diagram shows the sequences involved in using keypairs to
sign and verify a message stream.</p>

<p>The following example shows the code involved in the above sequence
diagram</p>

<pre>
ISignature dss = SignatureFactory.getInstance("DSS");
Map attrib = new HashMap();
attrib.put(ISignature.SIGNER_KEY, privateDsaKey);
dss.setupSign(attrib);

dss.update(message, 0, message.length);
Object sig = dss.sign();

ISignatureCodec codec = new DSSSignatureRawCodec();
byte[] encoded = codec.encodeSignature(sig);

Object sig2 = codec.decodeSignature(encoded);

attrib.clear();
attrib.put(ISignature.VERIFIER_KEY, publicDsaKey);
dss.setupVerify(attrib);

dss.update(message, 0, message.length);
boolean valid = dss.verify(sig);
