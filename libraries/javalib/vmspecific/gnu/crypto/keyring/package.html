Provides a basic API for managing private and public authentication credentials
stored in file objects.


<h2>Package overview</h2>

<p>The GNU Keyring file format is a proposed standard file format for the
long-term storage of cryptographic data, such as private keys and digital
certificates. This format is being designed with the following goals:

<ul>
   <li>Protection of trusted credentials, through the use of a password-based
   MAC (message authentication code) over these credentials.</li>
   <li>Protection of secret credentials, through the use of a password-based MAC
   over the data, which is encrypted with a strong, password-based cipher.</li>
   <li>Management of disparate types of cryptographic data, such as different
   types of digital certificate.</li>
   <li>Extensibility. It should be possible to extend the file format when new
   requirements arise, without undo breakage of existing applications.</li>
   <li>Compatibility with the JDK. This means that it should be possible to use
   this format as a keystore, so GNU implementations of the Java platform can
   provide the same functionality as the JDK.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The following two diagrams show the important classes participating in this
package. The first one showing the toplevel objects (files) , while the second
shows the classes representinf their contents:</p>
