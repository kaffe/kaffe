Provides the implementations of the SASL SRP mechanism, as specified in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-burdis-cat-srp-sasl-09.txt">
draft-burdis-cat-srp-sasl</a>.


<h2>Package overview</h2>

<p>The Secure Remote Password (<a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html">
SRP</a>) is a password-based, zero-knowledge, authentication and key-exchange
protocol developed by Thomas Wu. It has good performance, is not
plaintext-equivalent and maintains perfect forward secrecy. It provides
authentication (optionally mutual authentication) and the negotiation of a
session key.</p>

The mechanism described in the IETF Draft, and implemented in this library,
is based on the SRP-6 protocol, described in <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/design.html">
"SRP Protocol Design"</a> and <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/srp">"SRP:
The Open Source Password Authentication Standard"</a>. SRP-6 is an improved
version of the original SRP protocol (also called SRP-3) described in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2945.txt">RFC-2945</a>.</p>


<h2>Protocol description overview</h2>

<p>In this mechanism, the following exchange occurs when a new session is
negotiated between the client and the server. It will also occur when the
client requests re-use of the parameters of a previous session and either
the server does not support such re-use or no longer considers the previous
session to be valid:</p>

<p><img src="{@docRoot}/../manual/diagrams/srp_initial.png"
         width=330 height=206 border=0 align="center"></p>

<p>Where:
<ul>
	<li><b>U</b>: is the authentication identity (username),</li>
	<li><b>I</b>: is the authorisation identity (userid),</li>
	<li><b>sid</b>: is the identifier of a previous session whose
	parameters the client wishes to re-use,</li>
	<li><b>cn</b>: is the client's nonce used in deriving a new shared
	context key from the shared context key of the previous session,</li>
	<li><b>0x00</b>: is an octet indicating that the previous session
	parameters will NOT be re-used,</li>
	<li><b>N</b>: is the safe prime modulus,</li>
	<li><b>g</b>: is the generator,</li>
	<li><b>s</b>: is the user's password salt,</li>
	<li><b>B</b>: is the server's ephemeral public key,</li>
	<li><b>L</b>: is the options list indicating available security
	services,</li>
	<li><b>A</b>: is the client's ephemeral public key,</li>
	<li><b>M1</b>: is the client's evidence that the shared key K is known,</li>
	<li><b>o</b>: is the options list indicating chosen security services,</li>
	<li><b>cIV</b>: is the client's initial vector for the chosen encryption
	algorithm,</li>
	<li><b>M2</b>: is the server's evidence that the shared key K is known,</li>
	<li><b>sIV</b>: is the server's initial vector for the chosen encryption
	algorithm,</li>
	<li><b>sid</b>: is the identifier the server gives to this session for
	possible later re-use of the negotiated parameters,</li>
	<li><b>ttl</b>: is the time period for which this session's parameters
	may be re-usable.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, the following exchange occurs when the client requests
that the parameters negotiated in a previous session be re-used in this
session, but with a newly derived shared context key, and the server agrees:</p>

<p><img src="{@docRoot}/../manual/diagrams/srp_reuse.png"
         width=330 height=131 border=0 align="center"></p>

<p>Where:
<ul>
	<li><b>0xFF</b>: is an octet indicating that the previous session
	parameters will be re-used,</li>
	<li><b>sn</b>: is the server's nonce used in deriving a new shared context
	key from the shared context key of the previous session.</li>
</ul>
</p>
