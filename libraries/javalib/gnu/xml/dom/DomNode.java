/**
 * <p> "Node", "EventTarget", and "DocumentEvent" implementation.
 * This provides most of the core DOM functionality; only more
 * specialized features are provided by subclasses.  Those subclasses may
 * have some particular constraints they must implement, by overriding
 * methods defined here.  Such constraints are noted here in the method
 * documentation. </p>
 *
 * <p> Note that you can create events with type names prefixed with "USER-",
 * and pass them through this DOM.  This lets you use the DOM event scheme
 * for application specific purposes, although you must use a predefined event
 * structure (such as MutationEvent) to pass data along with those events.
 * Test for existence of this feature with the "USER-Events" DOM feature
 * name.</p>
 *
 * <p> Other kinds of events you can send include the "html" events,
 * like "load", "unload", "abort", "error", and "blur"; and the mutation
 * events.  If this DOM has been compiled with mutation event support
 * enabled, it will send mutation events when you change parts of the
 * tree; otherwise you may create and send such events yourself, but
 * they won't be generated by the DOM itself. </p>
 *
 * <p> Note that there is a namespace-aware name comparison method,
 * <em>nameAndTypeEquals</em>, which compares the names (and types) of
 * two nodes in conformance with the "Namespaces in XML" specification.
 * While mostly intended for use with elements and attributes, this should
 * also be helpful for ProcessingInstruction nodes and some others which
 * do not have namespace URIs.
